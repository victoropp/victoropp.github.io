### [Wine Clustering with GMM vs KMeans](https://github.com/victoropp/wine-clustering-gmm-kmeans)
A scientific unsupervised learning project using the UCI Wine dataset to compare Gaussian Mixture Models and KMeans:
- Auto-selection of cluster count using Elbow, Silhouette, AIC, and BIC  
- Visualised results using PCA, t-SNE, GMM heatmaps, and entropy plots  
- Evaluation via ARI, DBI, and Silhouette  
- Mapped real-world applications across food science, healthcare, and retail
