##  Hello, I'm Victor Collins Oppon

I'm a Chartered Accountant (FCCA) and MSc Data Science candidate based in the United Kingdom, originally from Ghana. After over 15 years leading finance, strategy, and compliance functions, I transitioned into data science to solve high-impact problems through intelligent, data-driven solutions.

##  My Transition

After building a strong career in financial leadership roles, I realised that the future of impactful decision-making lies in the integration of **AI, machine learning**, and **data science**. I pursued a Master’s in Data Science to complement my accounting expertise with advanced technical skills — and now I’m building systems that combine both worlds.
