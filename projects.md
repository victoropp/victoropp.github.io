##  Featured Project: Spam Detection in MATLAB

**Type**: Classification | Model Deployment | Benchmarking  
**Tools**: MATLAB, Naive Bayes, ROC/AUC, Logistic Regression, Hyperparameter Tuning  
**Summary**:  
Built a robust spam detection model using the UCI Spambase dataset with end-to-end deployment support.

 Highlights:
- Kernel-based Naive Bayes with optimized smoothing  
- Feature pruning and confidence intervals using bootstrap  
- ROC curve and AUC evaluation  
- Logistic regression comparison  
- Deployed via `saveLearnerForCoder` for integration

## Featured Project: Wine Clustering with GMM vs KMeans

**Type**: Unsupervised Learning | Scientific Comparison | Visualization  
**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, GMM, KMeans, PCA, t-SNE, DBSCAN  
**Summary**:  
Applied clustering algorithms on the UCI Wine Dataset to uncover latent groupings based solely on chemical composition — without using labels.

Highlights:
- Automatic cluster selection using Elbow, Silhouette, AIC, and BIC  
- Comparative analysis of GMM (soft clustering) and KMeans (hard clustering)  
- Visual insights via PCA, t-SNE, decision boundaries, and entropy heatmaps  
- Full metric evaluation using ARI, DBI, Silhouette Score  
- Real-world application mapping in food science, healthcare, retail, and more

##  Forecasting: Procurement Spend Analytics _(Coming Soon)_

**Type**: Time Series Forecasting | Business Intelligence  
**Tools**: Python, Facebook Prophet, Power BI, Streamlit  
**Summary**:  
Forecasting monthly procurement spend and identifying anomalies for strategic procurement planning.

 Features:
- Prophet modeling of historical supplier spend  
- Comparison of actual vs forecast  
- Power BI dashboard with vendor-level breakdowns

---
