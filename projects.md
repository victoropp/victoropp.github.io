##  Featured Project: Spam Detection in MATLAB

**Type**: Classification | Model Deployment | Benchmarking  
**Tools**: MATLAB, Naive Bayes, ROC/AUC, Logistic Regression, Hyperparameter Tuning  
**Summary**:  
Built a robust spam detection model using the UCI Spambase dataset with end-to-end deployment support.

 Highlights:
- Kernel-based Naive Bayes with optimized smoothing  
- Feature pruning and confidence intervals using bootstrap  
- ROC curve and AUC evaluation  
- Logistic regression comparison  
- Deployed via `saveLearnerForCoder` for integration
